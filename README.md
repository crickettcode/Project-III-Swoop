### These are the Technologies that I used ..
+ Trello - for user stories 
+ Heroku - application deployment and sharing 
+ Imgur - host for photos of wireframe and E.R.D
+ React - as a front end framework 
+ Mongo - database 
+ Express/Node - server 
+ VSCode - text editor 


### Obstacles 

I found that the biggest challenge in this project wasn't the  stress of project itself, but *overcoming the stress surrounding the project*. I believe that just beginning was one of the most difficult parts. Through this, I learned a great deal about "managing my stress levels" and maintaining a healthy work / life balance. I also started each morning with my favorite podcast, "Developer Tea" as well as a gratitude list to keep my outlook positive. This has really been a valuable skill as it is one that I will continue to practice throughout my career as a developer.
