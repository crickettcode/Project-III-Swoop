# Project-III-Swoop
Project III/ Swoop - the app that makes the plan, so that you be spontaneous ..


## Design and Functionality

+ My app was designed to provide a plan when you have guests in town to visit. I often find that half of the battle in entertaining guests is making a decision on what to do in a large city. This app was created as a solution. The final build would choose itinerary for specific events the user selected by using a random API. It would pull in current events and activities in that area and structure your trip around those events so the only job left for you and your guests would be to relax and enjoy the ride.

### These are the Technologies that I used ..
+ Trello - for user stories 
+ Heroku - application deployment and sharing 
+ Imgur - host for photos of wireframe and E.R.D
+ React - as a front end framework 
+ Mongo - database 
+ Express/Node - server 
+ VSCode - text editor 
+ Styled Components 
+ Material UI

### Obstacles 

+ I found that the biggest challenge in this project wasn't the  stress of project itself, but *overcoming the stress surrounding the project*. I believe that just beginning was one of the most difficult parts. Through this, I learned a great deal about "managing my stress levels" and maintaining a healthy work / life balance. I also started each morning with my favorite podcast, "Developer Tea" as well as a gratitude list to keep my outlook positive. This has really been a valuable skillset to learn as it is one that I will continue to practice throughout my career as a developer.

+ Another challenge I faced was switching to *React* for my front-end (client-side) instead of using *Handlebars*.  
+ Learning to route with *React* was also a new challenge as well as styling components.

### Take-Aways


+ For me, this project was more about personal growth as a developer than technical growth. Although, I did learn an immense amount technically, I also learned how to be more patient with myself in the learning process. Prior to this project, I often let my anxiety take control rather than taking control of my anxiety and creating a plan beforehand to manage my stress levels. In the future, I know to be proactive about my stressors surrounding large projects and ways to alleviate that stress before it gets to be overwhelming. 
+ CSS skills, As a full stack developer,I have learned that these matter just as much as my ability to make my projects function properly. 

### Improvements 

+ I would like to continue using *React* in building projects and continue to practice learning the language. I would also like to vastly improve my use of CSS and front-end design. 
+ Overall, this project was the most difficult but also the one that taught me the most. I am proud of myself for perseverance and am happy with my progress.
