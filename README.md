### These are the Technologies that I used ..
+ Trello - for user stories 
+ Heroku - application deployment and sharing 
+ Imgur - host for photos of wireframe and E.R.D
+ React - as a front end framework 
+ Mongo - database 
+ Express/Node - server 
+ VSCode - text editor 
+ Styled Components 
+ Material UI

### Obstacles 

+ I found that the biggest challenge in this project wasn't the  stress of project itself, but *overcoming the stress surrounding the project*. I believe that just beginning was one of the most difficult parts. Through this, I learned a great deal about "managing my stress levels" and maintaining a healthy work / life balance. I also started each morning with my favorite podcast, "Developer Tea" as well as a gratitude list to keep my outlook positive. This has really been a valuable skillset to learn as it is one that I will continue to practice throughout my career as a developer.

+ Another challenge I faced was switching to *React* for my front-end (client-side) instead of using *Handlebars*.  
+ Learning to route with *React* was also a new challenge as well as styling components.

### Take-Aways


+ For me, this project was more about personal growth as a developer than technical growth. Although, I did learn an immense amount technically, I also learned how to be more patient with myself in the learning process. Prior to this project, I often let my anxiety take control rather than taking control of my anxiety and creating a plan beforehand to manage my stress levels. In the future, I know to be proactive about my stressors surrounding large projects and ways to alleviate that stress before it gets to be overwhelming. 
+ CSS skills, As a full stack developer,I have learned that these matter just as much as my ability to make my projects function properly.
